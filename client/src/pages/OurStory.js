			<p>
				We were two aspiring writers at Salt Lake Community College,
				believers in public transportation, and students of Charlotte
				Howe’s Grammar & Style class. We didn’t know each other then. We
				didn’t really know ourselves, either. Ashley had grand
				aspirations as she was preparing for a three-month family
				mission in the Philippines, to serve a 18-month full-time
				mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and
				to dedicate her life to educating and rehabilitating victims of
				sex trafficing and otherwise neglected children and also to be a
				full-time mother, while Zachary… well he was just happy to get
				out of the house.
			</p>
			<p>
				We got to know each other on public transportation. Our
				schedules and locations aligned so that we took the same train
				and bus to and from campus four days a week for almost four
				months. It is a miracle to us, as we believe that it was the
				best environment for us to connect and become friends, and we
				couldn’t have become close any other way.
			</p>
			<p>
				We both enjoyed and struggled with the friendship that developed
				rapidly from our transit adventures and grammar class
				connection. Our conversations were filled with respect and
				patience like we had never known, but we also felt limited by
				the assumption that, in the large picture, we were too
				incompatible to ever expand beyond the convenience of our
				practical time together.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the semester was coming to a close, our relationship was
				still rather undefined, as we were too close to be “just
				friends”, but also still too distanced to be a couple. Ashley
				set out to correct this vagueness, and Zachary encouraged an
				experimental relationship, despite the assumed differences.
			</p>
			<p>
				We started officially dating, and our relationship once again
				transformed as we soon realized that our values, which we
				assumed were incompatible, were actually nearly identical—just
				framed differently. This miraculous discovery propelled our
				relationship to new heights, and our focus shifted away from
				inquiries about the possibility of a relationship into the more
				pragmatic aspects of trying to integrate our lives while still
				keeping our balance. We often use a particular word to describe
				our relationship (as well as how we see life in general) to
				visualize and comprehend what we’ve experienced: It is a <span className='font-eng-i'>dance</span>.
				And as we have spun and tripped and gotten dizzy, we’ve also
				clasped hands, jumped, and flown.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we have danced together, our lives now are unrecognizable to
				the young aspiring writers of almost two years ago. Our faith
				and our gratitude in the Lord have changed us, preparing us for
				the trials and joy ahead, as we will now dance as husband and
				wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are so joyous to announce that after four months of
				unintentional dating, and one year and seven months of
				companionship preparation—including four separate occasions of
				long-distance separation—we feel that we are not only ready, but
				that it is necessary for our future development to visit the
				Lord in his house and to be joined in holy matrimony.
