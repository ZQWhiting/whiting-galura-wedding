					The Covenant of Marriage: Our Testimonies
				</h2>
				<p>
					I’ve always known I wanted to marry in the temple. I grew up
					singing the children’s song “I Love to See the Temple,”
					which still has a special place in my heart. It speaks of
					the hope of someday attending the house of the Lord, about
					the joy of connecting with God through ordinances and
					covenants there. The second verse in particular talks about
					preparing to one day marry and begin an eternal family,
					which has become a very real goal for me as I’ve matured and
					now progressed with Zachary. The song as a whole became my
					personal anthem when Zachary and I were first “dating” as
					friends, and I had the privilege of preparing for and
					receiving the endowment ordinance (preparatory to the
					sealing ordinance).
				</p>
				<p>
					That was a really sacred time for me, a time when seeking
					the Lord became a deeply integral part of my life—more than
					ever before. Through my endowment, I came to understand my
					relationship with Christ in more profound ways, learning and
					growing this past year and a half as I’ve prepared for my
					next covenant with God.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I’ve approached this point of readiness, I can say in all
					certainty that it is my Savior, Jesus Christ, who has guided
					me every step of the way, providing for me personally and
					showing me the joyous possibilities of joining together with
					an eternal companion in His temple. I am so grateful for
					every gift along the way, and ultimately for this gift of an
					eternal marriage with my beloved Zachary.
				</p>
				<h5 className='align-center name-padding'>~Ashley</h5>
				<p>
					In my teenage years, I became very disillusioned with life.
					Not a whole lot really made sense to me. Among mostly
					everything else, things like society, people, happiness,
					sorrow, pain, and love were all too abstract for me to
					comprehend. My desires, purposes, beliefs, identities, and
					needs were very limited and in constant decline. In short, I
					was depressed. The only things I truly cared about were
					being a “good kid”, and loving my future wife someday.
					Nothing else really mattered.
				</p>
				<p>
					Time passed and I broke and matured. I more or less learned
					about all those things I lacked, but I lost hope in those
					things that truly mattered to me, and so it was an empty
					knowledge. I had long since been stripped of my title as the
					“good kid”, and marriage was as far away as the stars in my
					mind. Surely, my life would have been nothing more than a
					lonely struggle had it not been for the Lord, the same Lord
					whom I despised, who was always watching over me, teaching
					me what I needed to know before I met my faithful wife.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then, when I did meet her, and when I decided to pursue
					her, everything changed. I found the missing pieces of my
					soul, and it all came together in a single being, perfect
					and all encompassing, the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly
					Father, who are separate and One.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have given to them everything I know how, and I continue
					to give everything I know how. Ashley and I, both separately
					and together, give this marriage to Them, for them to keep,
					as an offering and as a witness, that all things are One and
					all things belong to Them.
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter what happens from here on, it will be okay. We are
					loved by One who watches us, who knows us, and we are about
					to be given the ultimate gift of being able to love
					eternally.
				</p>
